        Whether that's ditching the mid-afternoon energy slump so you can be active with your kids after school, banishing the expanding midsection that's making it harder to slide into your work trousers each passing year, or finally having the body confidence to buy clothes that show off your physique, rather than hide it
       <br>

       In just 42 days we'll take you from feeling frustrated with your current trajectory, to feeling proud of the positive habits you've built
